# 2020 Data Visualization CS 6630 Completed Homeworks

This repository contains the solutions to the homework assignments for the 2020
Data Visualization course (CS 6630/CS5630) taught by Alex Lex. The original assignments
can be found in the [2020_dataviscourse_homework](https://github.com/dataviscourse/2020_dataviscourse_homework)
repository.

The solutions contained here include the ones posted by the teaching mentors and
the ones completed by me, Dave Sant. Most assignments contain new information that
could only have been generated this year, and I believe homework assignments in following
years will also contain new information. However, If you are taking this course in a
later year, please do not copy anything from this repository as that would be cheating.

My final project is posted in another GitHub repository, [dataviscourse-clinvar_lovd_overlap](https://github.com/davidwsant/dataviscourse-clinvar_lovd_overlap). The functional webpage is hosted using
GitPages](https://davidwsant.github.io/dataviscourse-clinvar_lovd_overlap/).
